## Ascal’s Tomb

### Entrance {#entrance}

_At the back of the dig site there is a door. On either side of the door there
is a statue of what looks to be the same person. He is an elf, wearing robes
that look like they belong to a mage, and a circlet with a gem on their heads.
There looks to be a small circular indentation on their chest, with a narrow
line encircling their neck, almost like a pendant has been removed from each
statue._

_The only noticeable difference between the statues is the colour of the gem in
the circlet, the left statue having a purple amethyst, and the right having
a green emerald._

There are some amulets in the museum. Their stones match the circlets. Put
them on the statues to open the door.

There are also guided tours of this and the first two rooms, for a price.

### First chamber {#first-chamber}

A long room with columns along the sides, with statues and stuff shoved into
alcoves between the columns. Four cultists sat around a long stone table in
the centre of the room, some other unused chairs.

This is like an exhibit/storage room that doubles as a guard room. Probably
has a cultist or four hanging around in here. There is a locked wooden door
into the second chamber.

### Second chamber {#second-chamber}

Kind of a crypt room, with some sarcophagi for minor friends of Ascal.
Somewhat undisturbed, but no grave goods. Messing around in here too long
activates a spooker.

### Summoning Antechamber {#summoning-antechamber}

Small room overlooking the summoning room. This is at about ceiling height,
with a window on the far wall overlooking the summoning chamber. There is
a panel with a bunch of levers on it on the right hand wall, with a circular
indentation like on the entrance statues. This accepts a cultist’s amulet.
The levers control the angle of the mirrors.

Spiral stair down to the summoning room. Video game it and drop some health
potions here or something.

### Summoning Room {#summoning-room}

_You enter a large circular room, with two levels. You’re on the upper level,
which is a narrow pathway around the edge of the room, about 10 feet above
the proper floor._

_Six silver mirrors are hanging from the ceiling, reflecting beams of eerie
magical light which originate from runes on the wall. The mirrors reflect
the light down onto a lens which has been set up to focus the beam onto an
open sarcophagus, above which floats a giant spectral figure. There are
three cultists sat on stools around the edge of the lower floor, staring
reverently at the ghost._

Showdown in the secret ghost room with Ascal Kelmaris and a couple of
cultists.

Rays of magic/light that are focused into a summoning point using moveable
mirrors, some suspended from the ceiling.

Cultists want to stop them doing that obviously, if they notice the party
then they will engage, but focus on defending the apparatus.

Probably hard to physically harm the ghost but maybe with magic?
