## North Road

_You’re all heading to the town of Thornhill along a road that has been winding
down through a thick and imposing pine forest. The birds are singing their
evening songs, and there is a mild breeze The sun is setting behind the
trees to the west, and the town is finally visible about half a mile away
along the road._

The party starts on the North Road out of Thornhill, about half a mile from
town. They’ve bumped into each other, all headed to Thornhill for their own
reasons. (unless that’s not true). Do some introductions and initial RP here.

_Suddenly, you notice that the birds have all fallen silent. Even the breeze
has fallen still and an eerie silence sits about you._

As they’re chatting and about to arrive, everything goes quiet and the
temperature drops. They might see a figure in the woods, or maybe just a
flash of red robes. In the woods, they can find a cultist’s amulet with a
deer’s head surrounded by a ring of thorns engraved on it, which matches
the symbol on the museum doorway.
