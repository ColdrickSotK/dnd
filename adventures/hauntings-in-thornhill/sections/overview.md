## Overview

There is a ghost called Ascal Kelmaris who lives in the underground tomb
under Thornhill Museum. Formerly an elven mage, some academics with an
interest in necromancy recently heard there is a powerful artifact inside
his tomb.

They obtained the museum and began researching the tomb inside. Some of
them decided to try to resurrect Ascal; others disagreed. The resurrection
went a little bit wrong and instead they summoned a ghostly spectre of
Ascal. Theyâ€™re using his power to threaten the dissenters to keep everything
under cover, whilst also slowly being driven mad by the presence of the ghost.

As the ghost grows more powerful, more and more hauntings are occurring in
the area, both in the forest to the north of town, and in the streets and
buildings around the Museum.

The townsfolk near the northern gate are tired of being woken up by bumps in
the night and want some brave people to investigate properly. Weird happenings
in the surrounding forests are also putting people off from visiting the town.
