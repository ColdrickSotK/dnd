The town of Thornhill is beset by strange apparitions and unnerving
occurences. Visitors are being put off by weird happenings in the forests
around the northern road, and the local economy is suffering.

The townsfolk are tired of being awoken by bumps in the night, and want
some brave adventurers to investigate and put an end to it.
