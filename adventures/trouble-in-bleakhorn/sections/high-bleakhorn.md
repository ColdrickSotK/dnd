## High Bleakhorn

High Bleakhorn is a ruined town. The architecture and town design is largely
pre-imperial, with the centrepiece being a ruined temple. The town is arranged
around the base of a cliff, atop which sits the ruined temple.

### Bleakhorn Temple {#bleakhorn-temple}

This ruined temple is the meeting place of the cult. It’s a small-ish temple
with classical architecture, like a miniature parthenon. The temple is in the
early stages of ruination, and still has a recognisable indoors and outdoors.
The interior walls are decorated with vibrant frescoes depicting lush forests
full of colourful birds.

Scattered around are hints of evidence that people have been around here
recently; burnt out torches, footprints, and scrape marks around the base of a
door set beneath the central altar.

### Castil’s Cave {#castils-cave}

The door under the central altar leads down into the temple catacombs. This is
a twisting mess of a place with old coffins stacked up around the place. There’s
an embalming room in the maze of tunnels and little tombs which has been turned
into something of an office and base of operations for the cult. There’s likely
to be a cultist or two in here. Depending on the time of day there might also be
cultists lurking in other parts of the catacombs; some of the tombs have been
turned into little breakout rooms.

One of the tombs is notable for the twisted thorny vines carved into the walls
and ceiling, which is unlike the more cheery and human decor of the other tombs.
At the back of this tomb is a stone door (DC 10 perception). At the right time
(just after any meetings in the temple, or at the daily worship times (7am and
7pm) a cultist or 3 can be seen opening this door and heading inside.

This door leads to a winding tunnel that heads downwards, becoming more and more
cavelike. Eventually it opens out into a large room lit by an eerie glow from
bioluminescent fungi scattered around the edge. In the centre of the room is
an enormous tree. On close inspection, the tree is made of stone, and covered
in carved geometric patterns.

When approached, the tree awakens. The carvings glow green and Castil
communicates with the intruders telepathically.
