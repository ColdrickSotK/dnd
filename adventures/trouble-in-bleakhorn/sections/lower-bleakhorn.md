## Lower Bleakhorn

Lower Bleakhorn is a respectable country town with respectable people in
it. It’s an old place with roots in the ancient pre-imperial times. Back
then it was a farming village which supported the busier and more notable
High Bleakhorn, a mining town turned regional government seat.

These days High Bleakhorn is in ruins, and Lower Bleakhorn is a hidden gem
in the breadbasket of the Empire. It’s a bustling local administrative
centre, but is still in touch with and proud of its farming roots.

There’s a faction of townsfolk who call themselves the Farmers of Hardelm.
They’ve been causing trouble and inciting rebellion. Recently things have
come to a head with the kidnap and soon ransom of a local governmental
figure.

### The Giant’s Well {#the-giants-well}

A busy tavern/tapas bar/whatever eating/drinking establishment is needed.

### Lower Bleakhorn Agricultural Museum {#lower-bleakhorn-agricultural-museum}

This museum is used by cultists as a HQ in town, it’s also where the
kidnapped person is being kept (well fed and well cared for, they’re here
to make money and cause chaos, not do anything triggering).

There are some hints that this is the location of the kidnapped person;

- Food has been going missing from the cafe
- Lights were seen inside the main visitor centre past closing about a week
  and a half ago, very unusual
- Keys to one of the living history buildings went missing a few weeks ago

There’s a gift shop and cafe. The cafe serves traditional wholesome country
fare, all grown in the museum. The gift shop is basically a garden centre.
