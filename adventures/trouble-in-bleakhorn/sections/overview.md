## Overview

There’s a cult in the mountainside town of Lower Bleakhorn. They’ve been
causing trouble and inciting rebellion for months, and things are coming
to a head.

The regional governor sent a regiment of Imperial troops to calm things
down, and the troubles melted away without any trace before they even
arrived. When the troops left, the trouble started back up as if it never
went away.

The leadership has decided that a more targeted approach is needed,
handling the top brass of the cult instead of oppressing the whole local
population.

There’s just one problem, the local government has no idea who the
ringleaders are. The need to address this problem has been thrown into
sharp focus in the last couple of weeks, with the disappearance of **Godlaf**,
a prominent council member.
