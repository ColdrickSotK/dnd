## Tackdell

Tackdell is a sleepy village nestled in the heart of the Esgar forest.
Made up mostly of wood and turf buildings, and surrounded by a wooden
palisade, it is almost a part of the forest itself. It’s been there as
long as anyone can remember.

### Tackdell Rings {#tackdell-rings}

Tackdell Rings is a henge, barely visible in the forest undergrowth. It
consists of a ring ditch with an external bank, with 3 megaliths erected
in the centre. In the centre of the megaliths is a large flat table-like
stone covered in moss and lichen. In the centre of the stone there’s a
barely visible carving of a stag’s head surrounded by thorns.

### Main Street {#main-street}

Main Street in Tackdell runs through an unusual earthwork. Some
archaeological-ish investigation would reveal this to be an ancient
cursus, part of the same ritual landscape as the Rings, the Stones,
and the numerous barrows.

Processions used to take place here, both taking bodies from the Rings
to the barrow and performing the ritual needed to use the Wishing Stones.
There’s a chance (say 50%) that people staying the night will be awakened
(subject to perception checks) by ghosts performing one of those processions
to this day.

### The Wizened Pine {#the-wizened-pine}

A classic rustic tavern, with a sign depicting an ancient looking pine tree.
The clientele here are not greatly fond of outsiders, and are especially
unhappy about the "bloody antiquarians" that are attracting lots of strangers
to the town. However, some of them can be won over fairly easily with a bit
of chatting and provision of alcohol.

The Wizened Pine serves

- regular and generic ale and cider
- the local specialty, Mountainside Mead (made with heather honey from bees
  in the apiary out on the edge of the forest)
- wine imported from the coastal vineyards of Fairhaven, for a steeper price

They also provide food. The menu at the moment is

- Selected roast meats with all the trimmings
- Selected roast meats on bread
- Venison stew
- Tomato, chickpea, and roasted vegetables (courgette, onion, potato, peppers)
  stew

The rooms upstairs are reasonably well appointed, with comfortable beds, a
small table with a few chairs, and a dresser beneath a window which looks out
onto Main Street.

#### NPCs

- **Stalvor Cragmark**, he/him, landlord, friendly and welcoming
- **Vorsir the Hook**, he/him, local fisherman, drunk and miserable but helpful
  if people are friendly
- **Swanly Sun-Fang**, she/her, another frustrated local

### Meeting Post {#meeting-post}

A large wooden post, situated across the side-street from the Wizened Pine.
It is used as a local meeting point, and currently has a sign nailed to it
advertising the times of guided trips to the Wishing Stones. The next trip
sets off midmorning the following day.

### Graveyard {#graveyard}

Tackdell has an extremely large graveyard. Most of it isn't very well
maintained, and the further from the small shrine near the entrance you go,
the more overgrown and worn the stones get.

At the far back of the graveyard are a number of overgrown round barrows.
They aren't chambered barrows or spooky tombs, just mounds of earth with
graves dug into them.
