## Overview

Some antiquarians have recently discovered some ancient standing stones
that are said to grant wishes. Pilgrims and adventurers have flocked to
see them and use them from far and wide. However, the villagers in nearby
Tackdell don't seem convinced.

The party have heard stories of these stones, and have travelled to
Tackdell to see if they live up to the rumours. They arrive in Tackdell
as the last rays of the evening sun are dappling the road through the pine
needles above, likely in need of rest after a day of hiking.
