## Tackdell Barrow

This is the long barrow which the wishing stones stand in front of. From
the outside it appears to be a pretty standard form of chambered burial
mound, but inside it is in fact one of the most remarkable examples known
to exist.

The burial tomb of Rin Moongleam, one of the foremost priests of Taekde at
the time, this appears to be a normal chambered burial mound, with an
antechamber containing a few burial slots leading to the main above-ground
chamber, which has a large sarcophagus in the centre.

That sarcophagus is actually empty, and covers a hole in which the rest of
the tomb can be found. It’s hard to see in the hole, but it’s about a 30ft
drop through air to reach a kind of circular mezzanine level.

### Mezzanine {#mezzanine}

This is a large circular room, 30ft in height at the tallest point. It has
a beautiful vaulted ceiling, covered in intricate carved plant designs
looking like knotted undergrowth or the roots of a great tree.

It’s pitch black in here, and the southern third of the room has no floor,
instead it overlooks a lower chamber. In the centre of the room, on the edge
of the floor, is a reasonably large altar, also intricately carved in the
form of trees. Atop the centre of the altar is what appears to be the
magnificent skull of a particularly large stag with moss hanging down
underneath it. There are mostly burnt candles in an antler candelabra and
various treasures are strewn across it as offerings.

Surrounding this altar on the floor side are an array of curved benches,
arranged such that anyone sitting on them is facing directly at the altar
itself.

Behind the benches, there are some finely carved statues, some depicting
animals and some depicting people. Finally, burial nooks line the wall
behind the statues, again all facing inwards to the central altar.

There’s not much going on in this room on the way down. Make sure to build
some suspense by making it feel just a little bit too quiet, and a little
bit too dark. On the way up it might be a similar experience, or it might
be absolutely full of angry skeletons, depending on how the orb is obtained.

In the part of the room where there is no floor, there is a drop of about
40ft through air into the depths of the barrow.

### Depths {#depths}

The deep chamber is a round chamber, similar to the mezzanine with a carved
and painted vaulted roof.

This room contains 16 statues positioned roughly evenly around the edge of
the room. In the centre of the room is what appears to be a stone fountain,
though it looks to have run dry in the thousands of years since the tomb was
constructed.

There are a number of narrow passages leading off from this chamber, some so
narrow it’d be easy for someone not being careful to get stuck.

#### Pool room

One passage starts off reasonably sized, and gets lower and lower until there
is only room to crawl. This leads to a room with a deep pool and some greenery,
lit by a glowing magical artifact suspended above the pool. There are benches
around the edge of the room, and the walls are carved and painted with nature
scenes. There is a statue of a hooded druid-like figure in this room, crouched
by the pool. The statue is wearing a removable amulet of Taekde. If the amulet
is removed, then the statue will stand up when people aren’t paying attention,
and otherwise be unresponsive.

The pool is icy cold, and stepping into it requires a DC15 constitution saving
throw to not be affected by the chill. On passing the check the pool feels like
a normal deep pool of cold water, not pleasant to be in. On failing the check,
the character’s sight fades away and they experience a vision depicting roughly
the opposite of whatever Wishing Stones related wish is in their heart.

#### Dark room

Another passage gets quite narrow, but still walkable. About halfway down the
passage it’s possible to make out a glinting gem suspended from the ceiling
above a sarcophagus in the room at the end.

The room is full of magical darkness, and anyone inside the room cannot see
without truesight. Taking the glinting gem from the ceiling will end the spell,
as does completely covering the gem.

There are some valuable funerary offerings in this room, along with an amulet
of Taekde atop the sarcophagus.

#### The Squeeze

One of the corridors similarly gets narrow, but continues getting narrower
until it must be squeezed through sideways. This ends in a room almost
identical to the dark room, but without the magical darkness. Instead, there
is no sound audible in this room.

#### Store room

The penultimate corridor seems to remain the same size all along. However,
there’s a trip line in it which requires a DC15 dex check to avoid tripping.
Close failure (DC10) results in rocks being dropped where the tripper was
standing, but the tripper manages to evade them. More serious failure results
in 1d6 of bludgeoning damage.

At the end of this corridor is a small room full of shelving. There is an
amulet of Taekde hanging on the corner of one of the shelves. There are also
a few crates scattered around the shelves, which contain a few glass vials of
a shimmering red liquid.

#### Orb antechamber

One of the corridors leads to a small room. This room has detailed geometric
patterns carved into the walls, and a carving of a stag’s head above a small
opening about 2ft square in the far wall. The area in the wall around the
carving looks like it was filled in some time after the initial construction
when investigated closely.

This narrow opening is a crawlable corridor which is about 10ft long, and at
the other side is the burial chamber of the High Priest, containing the main
treasure.

### Priest Chamber {#priest-chamber}

This is another round chamber. The walls here are less intricately carved,
and the stones in the wall are more roughly hewn. Around the edge of the
room are 5 well-carved statues of human-looking people dressed in
religious-looking robes, each one unique. In the centre of the room is a large
sarcophagus, with a small 4ft tall pillar at its foot. The sarcophagus and
pillar are covered in geometric patterns, and the sarcophagus has an
inscription on the lid.

The inscription reads (in an ancient, unreadable script)

_Here lies High Priest Rin Moongleam_

_Follower of Daegder in life_

_Friend of Daegder in death_

_Watched by five_

_Let no others disturb their rest_

Above the inscription, amongst the geometric patterns, there is a carved
circle of thorns containing a stag’s head.

If the sarcophagus is tampered with and the statues are not wearing amulets
of Taekde, then the statues will awaken and attempt to put a stop to the
tampering, by whatever means necessary. They won’t leave the room though.

In the sarcophagus is a skeleton, wearing the decomposed remains of what were
obviously very fine clothes. In its hands is an intricately carved orb, the
geometric inscriptions pulsing with a blue light.

If the orb is placed on the pillar, then a ghost of Rin will appear and advise
the people who put it there to put it back where it came from and reseal the
tomb. If pushed hard enough then they’ll go into a bit of detail on the
capabilities of the orb.

The ghost will offer a Wish (within some stricter limits than the actual
spell, on account of the magic waning over the years) to each party member
if they replace the orb in the sarcophagus and reseal the tomb.

The ghost will allow the party to take the orb for research and
academic/museum reasons after being persuaded (let’s say a DC18 persuasion
check), but will not provide the Wish castings in that case.

Taking the orb past the pillar at the foot of the sarcophagus without
permission will cause it to start vibrating and glowing more brightly.
The carvings on the pillar will also start to glow with a faint blue
light.

Taking the orb out of the burial chamber without permission will basically
cause all hell to break loose. The character possessing the orb will hear
a voice in their head commanding them to relinquish the orb. Upon continuing
along the corridor into the main room they will all hear the same voice
commanding them to relinquish the orb.

Upon setting foot in the main room, they will roll initiative against 6 of
the statues that border the room, and a horde of approx. 50 skeletons
climbing down from above. For each statue that goes down in the ensuing
fight another will awaken and join in until there are none remaining.

The enemies will mainly target whoever has the orb in this fight, and are
aiming to retrieve the orb at any cost. If they manage to regain the orb
then they’ll stop actively attacking the party and focus on returning it
to the burial chamber.
