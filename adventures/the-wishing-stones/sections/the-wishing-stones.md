## The Wishing Stones

A (formerly) overgrown set of standing stones, standing in front of a
long barrow in the depths of the Esgar forest about a mile out of
Tackdell. They’re the centrepiece of a large, ancient ritual landscape
spread throughout the Estergar forest, around Tackdell and the Stones.

The Stones are currently being investigated and excavated by a group of
antiquarians from Thornhill, a town about 30 miles to the north of
Tackdell.

The Stones are currently known as the Wishing Stones thanks to these
antiquarians running a side business in imaginary superstitious wish
granting, allegedly powered by the magic of the old gods. They’re selling
stones “found at the site”, enchanted with illusion magic to give the
impression of wishes being granted.

The antiquarians have been trying to spread the word of the magical site
to attract some adventurers they can hire with the money they’ve been
making to go into the barrow and retrieve an important historic artifact
(a Taekde Orb) expected to be in the tomb. These tombs have a reputation
for danger, hence looking to hire someone to do the dangerous part for
them whilst they do the boring part on the surface. The antiquarians are
happy to show a drawing of a Taekde Orb previously found in a similar
tomb in Thornhill if asked for more information.

They’re also looking for the adventurers to make the tomb safe for them
to enter and study at their leisure, so they can learn more about the
makers and record their findings for posterity.

### Antiquarians' Camp {#antiquarians-camp}

This is the camp where the antiquarians from Thornhill are staying. Set
a little way into the more dense woods back from the thinner trees around
the stones and barrow, it's made up of a few large tents, a decently sized
cart, and a few hastily constructed wooden sheds and lean-tos which seem
to mostly be used for storage.

Some of the things that can be found here include:

- Amulet of Fellmar (disk of jet with a raven engraved on it)
- Dig reports from the Wishing Stones
- Scribbled accounts for the trinket-based side business
- A couple of crates of random trinket rocks
- Excavation instructions from Thornhill
- Research paperwork on historic Taekde worship practices
- General bunch of stuff, plenty of general supplies like food, drink,
  and equipment like rope and shovels and buckets
- Some amulets of Taekde found in the excavations
