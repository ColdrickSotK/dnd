## Fairhaven

The town of Fairhaven is located at the mouth of the river Fair, on the
western coast of the Empire. It has a large port on the south bank of the
river, and subsequently the southern part of the town is heavily industry
focused and generally less well-off than the northern bank. The north side of
the town has a number of expensive neighbourhoods where the rich folk live.

There’s some mistrust between the sides, leading to the south bankers blaming
the northerners for the recent disappearances.

The players arrive in town through the eastern gate on the north bank of the
river, and walk right into an escalating confrontation between the north and
south bankers. They’re arguing over the recent disappearances.

### North Bank {#north-bank}

The north bankers are broadly haughty and snobbish about the southerners.
Obviously some of them are more sympathetic, but they’re largely Tory.
The north bankers hold the large wineries of the south bank in disdain,
and only outwardly support “traditional” businesses from the countryside.
Of course, they also own a significant number of the south bank wineries,
money is money.

They are convinced that the disappearances from the north bank are
southerners “getting up to their usual thieving nonsense”, and that
any disappearances from the south bank are just a frame job to divert
suspicion.

The renowned wine bar The Vineyard is on Temple Street on the north bank.

#### People

- Secundus Mallius, rich wine baron who claims his family has the ear of
  the emperor. Also owner of The Vineyard.
- Placus Cornelius, rich wine baron who traces his family history back
  through hundreds of years of wine making
- Antia Augusta, rich widow who moved to the idyllic Fairhaven for some
  sea air
- Tiberius Haraldsson, “self-made” wine baron who owns large south-bank
  wineries with some of the worst working conditions
- Octavia Fortunata, leader of a group who argue for better workers rights
  in Fairhaven wineries
- Velthur Valashna, an elf here to make a large wine deal

### South Bank {#south-bank}

The south bank is the docklands, followed by the industrial-scale wineries
who produce wine for export and various other local manufacturing and
production. This side of town is less well-off and is resentful of the
north bankers.

There’s also a healthy smuggling industry here in some of the wineries,
where workers skim off some of the wine to sell on the black market.
These smugglers can be found in the seedier taverns in town, and have
knowledge of the local smuggling routes and spots. As part of that
knowledge, they have rumours about what has made Hidewell Cave unusable.

The intriguing tavern The Barrel is by the docks on the south bank.
