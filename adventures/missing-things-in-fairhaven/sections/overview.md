## Overview

We're in wine country! The port town of Fairhaven is surrounded by vineyards,
where the famously high quality wine that makes up the majority of its exports
is grown. There's a north/south divide in town that is on the brink of
breaking out into something worse after what appears to be a string of petty
thefts.

It started with building materials disappearing, but progressed into food,
livestock, and even people disappearing. The south bankers blame the north
bankers for the thefts, the north bankers blame the south bankers for
disappearances on their side too. In reality, theyâ€™re both wrong.

The fishpeople are preparing to invade. These particular fish people are in
the service of a particularly ambitious mind flayer, who has taken it upon
themself to take control of the rich port of Fairhaven.
