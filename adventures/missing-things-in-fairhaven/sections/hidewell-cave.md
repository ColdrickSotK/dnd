## Hidewell Cave

A smugglers cave on the coast to the south of Fairhaven. It’s only accessible
by climbing along coastal cliffs or by using a small boat to sail inside, as
the entrance is entirely sea. Some way inside, the water gives way to a string
of medium to large caverns, which are used as either temporary shelter or
storage for the local smuggling rings. There’s even a bar, though it’s not used
by the current inhabitants.

All the caverns are currently storing various materials and tools stolen from
the town, and housing a growing force of Kuo Toa. The deepest cavern has been
remodeled into a horrific mockery of a throne room, and is inhabited by the mind
flayer who has ambitions on taking over the town of Fairhaven.

There are secret tunnels that lead into all the rooms, though they’re used by Kuo
Toa from time to time.
