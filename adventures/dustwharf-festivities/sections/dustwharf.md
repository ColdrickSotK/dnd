## Dustwharf

Dustwharf is a picturesque coastal town, situated on the west coast of the Foran Empire. To the north is deciduous woodland, and there is farmland to the south and east.

A central road runs north to south through town, and there’s a small dock on the shoreline. Up against the eastern wall of town is the College of Magic, towering over the rest of town. It’s a cathedral-looking thing, but a bit more magical and weird.

### Dustwharf South Gate + Streets {#dustwharf-south-gate}

The muddy streets of Dustwharf are quieter than would be expected on a festival day. Rain is lashing down, and water is flowing down most roads towards the docks.

There are people wandering around fetching and carrying things, in greater numbers closer to the town square. In general everyone seems miserable and are keeping themselves to themselves.

If pressed then people will complain about the weather getting them down. It just never rains at this time of year. Some might blame “bloody outsiders”, and others might complain about “those damn wizards”.

### GM Notes

#### Smells

That horrible wet smell when it’s been raining for ages, fish, woodsmoke, soil.

#### Sounds

Rain hitting rooftops, wind in trees, creaking door signs, squelching footsteps, grumbling voices.

#### Sights

Rain, flooded roads, mud, stone cottages, Ocean’s View Inn, college towers in the distance dominating the town.

#### Touchstones

The general vibe of the streets should be like when the hobbits arrive in Bree. Miserable, distrusting locals, generally wet and horrible.

#### Names

Orela Nust, Randro Volen, Adriana Eskval, Vinceo Most, Ronfero Astor

### Ocean’s View Tapas Bar {#oceans-view-tapas-bar}

This is a warm, welcoming, modern tapas restaurant and hotel, a nice place to go to hide from the weather. In fact, quite a number of the townsfolk have had the same idea, and it's pretty busy in here. The atmosphere is similar to outside rather than the festive cheer that would be expected, with people miserable and downbeat about the weather.

**Vaeris Olmus** the archaeologist is sitting alone at the bar. They’re looking for an ancient magical artefact to study. It’s rumoured that the College of Magic have some knowledge of its whereabouts, or perhaps even have it within their walls. The reclusive academic wizards there are refusing to answer the archaeologist’s inquiries. They’re looking for some more persuasive people to help them get hold of the artefact, or at least learn more about it.

The archaeologist doesn’t actually know what the artefact is, they just know it used to be a part of the Sun’s Return ritual in Dustwharf and is rumoured to have great power. Whether or not it ever actually existed is the main point of academic interest.

There’s also a really old bloke (**Scaro Feldman**) in here, wizened and shrivelled, and seemingly fuelled by alcohol, who will actually drop a big hint about how it’s the curse the wizards promised when his grandparents’ town elders forced them out of their role in the ritual. He’ll probably drop that in between completely nonsensical ravings about how it’s raining so much because the fish are invading or something similarly ridiculous.

### GM Notes

Faerin Utton, Staeskr Longstride, Kira Weston, Walfrey Greenfoot

### Dustwharf Town Square {#dustwharf-town-square}

The town elders are making preparations for the ancient Dustwharf tradition of the Sun’s Return (spring equinox) festival. Gazebos are going up because the weather is bad, but it hasn’t rained on Return in living memory. The elders are certain someone is trying to ruin the festival, and they reckon it’s the College of Magic.

They’re very much “it’s always been this way” types, and will tell a one-sided version of the ritual where the town elders have always been in control of making sure the sun returns properly.

### GM Notes

#### Smells

Smoke from cooking fires, sausages, bacon, onions, leather tents

#### Sounds

Grumbling elders, sizzling food, hammering/general construction sounds

#### Sights

Hastily constructed gazebos/tents, some people frying sausages, a gathering of elders

#### Touchstones

The elders are all extremely melodramatic and stuck-in-their-ways old people. Think horticultural society, or the more obnoxious old people in Midsomer Murders.

#### Names

Malrus Paeldaris, Prisa Nerus, Oscaerus Aefessu, Publius Scellus
