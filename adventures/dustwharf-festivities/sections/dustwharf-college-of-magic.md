## Dustwharf College of Magic

Specialist college in Conjuration and Transmutation.

### School of Conjuration {#school-of-conjuration}

The staff here can be cajoled into talking about an alumnus (staff or student? I think staff makes the tantrum funnier) who read into the ancient weather rituals as part of researching elemental magics. They discovered that it was the mages of this damn college who used to perform the ritual, and that power over the local people was stolen away by a previous generation of elders.

He spent a long time researching more and more about the ritual, and then disappeared a few months ago.

### GM Notes

Summoning spots, magical lighting, bookshelves

#### Names

Garius Varlheim, Heidri Arando, Vanya Telcontar

### School of Transmutation {#school-of-transmutation}

The staff here can be persuaded into talking about the same alumnus, but in more detail. They know some of his research, since the weather ritual involved transmutation magics.

They also know some stuff about the artefact the archaeologist wants to find. It is a powerful artefact which had some use in the ritual, something to do with the sun. They also know that the now overgrown cave Seawatch Cavern used to be used in the ritual.

### GM Notes

#### Names

Furca Grey-Mage, Rolfjorn the Gifted, Botten the Tiny

### Library {#library}

It’s like the library of your dreams.

The library contains an accurate account of the original form of the ritual. The artefact was actually only used for the mundane purpose of ensuring good weather for the partying, but the angry alumnus didn’t read that far. That mundane purpose was deliberately wrapped up in a fancy ritual, mostly as an excuse to have a good time (everyone loves a ritual).

The research done by the alumnus is here too, explaining how the artefact was a crucial part of the ritual, used to ensure the sun’s return in a weather temple now known as Seawatch Cavern. That’s backed up by some later accounts of the parties that can be found in the library too.

### GM Notes

Books, leather, pine furniture.

#### Sounds

Rustling of books, soft footsteps, rain hammering on windows.
