## Seawatch Cavern

### Entrance Hallway {#entrance-hallway}

This is entered through a large open cave entrance, and contains various bits of foliage along with a few boxes and general “someone lives here” accoutrements.

In the center of the room is a mound. Above it is a grate in the ceiling, with water occasionally dripping through onto the top of the mound. The mound has a deep 5ft wide bowl shape on top, engraved with a geometric pattern. There’s also a clear line engraved on the floor, which leads to and up the walls surrounding the open door at the other end of the room.

There are some fallen trees outside.

#### GM Notes

##### Touchstones

The way some Skyrim dungeons transition from cave into ruin.

### Riddle Room {#riddle-room}

This room is full of scorch marks and roughed-up ground. There’s obviously been a fight of some kind in here, probably involving mages. There are a couple of weather-themed pieces of sculpture in here, and the ceiling is intricately carved into an impression of the sky, with the sun in the centre.

Around some of the sculptures are pools of bubbling water. If the word water is said in the room, the water will bubble more intensely. On a second utterance, the pools will glow ominously. If it is said three times, four Lesser Water Elementals will rise from the pools and attack the party.

At the other end is a wooden door reinforced with iron and a magical ward. Above it is a stone tablet with the following text

```
Hold your tongue.
It runs, but never walks.
It babbles, but never talks.
It roars, but has no mouth.
It sparkles, but is not a star.
It will hold you, but only when cold.
In time, it moves mountains.
Give it to me.
```

The answer is of course water, and wetting the stone tablet will open the door. It needs a big splash ideally.

### Water Door {#water-door}

The penultimate room has a wooden door reinforced with iron and a magical ward.

In the center of the room is a mound with water pouring down the sides. Above it is a grate in the ceiling, with water pouring through onto the top of the mound. The mound has a deep 5ft wide bowl shape on top, filled with water and lined with glowing blue light. Emptying the bowl will open the door.

### Ritual Chamber {#ritual-chamber}

A room overlooking the ocean. It has a wizard on the other side of a 30ft wide chasm with the ocean in the bottom. On either side of the chasm there’s ruined pillars that once held a rope bridge, but it’s now long gone.

In front of the open window hole is a pedestal, with a large bowl of water on it. Dangling in the bowl from the wall above the hole is an amulet with a stone on. The stone is engraved with weather symbols, and a rain/cloud symbol is glowing blue.

The wall on one side of the window hole has a number of shelves, packed with fish bowls with fish in. The wall on the other side has shelves with books and scrolls, and an open door with a staircase behind it. Also on that side is a writing desk and a chair by a fire pit.

There’s a grate in the ceiling which leads into the room above where the wizard sleeps and keeps their belongings, to allow a watch over the main room.

The wizard is sitting in the chair next to the fire, relaxing and gazing out of the window enjoying the rain. They won’t notice the party unless they’re particularly loud. On being interacted with, they’ll express surprise at being found but will happily talk/gloat about their scheme. They’ll be a bit more cautious if the players have managed to sneak close by.

Their intention is to ruin Sun’s Return to kill the tradition off for good since it has been “sullied” by the exclusion of the mages. An even better outcome would be the festival returning to its roots and reintroducing the mages’ role, of course performed by only this wizard who cares about the “true” ritual. Ideally this wizard would hold the town basically hostage and have the townsfolk work for them, by controlling the local weather.

Despite this, the wizard is open to being talked around really. People will need to empathise with their side of things, the townsfolk did shove the mages out of the ritual for similar reasons in the first place after all. Learning their research is incomplete will also leave them feeling a complete idiot, and they’ll want help reconciling with the townsfolk.

The wizard can be provoked into a fight with some effort, which will cause two Water Elementals to rise up from the chasm. In combat Calrano will generally try to stay out of the way of the party and cast supporting spells.

#### GM Notes

##### Smells

Salt water, seaweed, fish.

##### Sounds

Crashing waves dominating all the other sound in the room.

##### Sights

Occasional sea spray bursting up from the chasm.

##### Touchstones

Sounds like “the cavern” at Whistling Sands, general Skyrim cave energy.
