## Overview

It’s the day of Sun’s Return, when the daylight outlasts the darkness for the first time since before the long winter months. There’s a big festival tonight, full of outdoor drinking, outdoor dancing, outdoor music, and also an outdoor tribute to the ancient weather ritual, but there is a problem.

It’s chucking it down with rain. Relentlessly. The festival is ruined. And it’s because a wizard, Calrano, is doing it.
