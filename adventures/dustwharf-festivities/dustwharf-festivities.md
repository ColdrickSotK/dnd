title: "Dustwharf Festivities"
---

## Overview

It’s the day of Sun’s Return, when the daylight outlasts the darkness for the first time since before the long winter months. There’s a big festival tonight, full of outdoor drinking, outdoor dancing, outdoor music, and also an outdoor tribute to the ancient weather ritual, but there is a problem.

It’s chucking it down with rain. Relentlessly. The festival is ruined. And it’s because a wizard, Calrano, is doing it.

## Dustwharf

Dustwharf is a picturesque coastal town, situated on the west coast of the Empire. To the north is deciduous woodland, and there is farmland to the south and east.

A central road runs north to south through town, and there’s a small dock on the shoreline. Up against the eastern wall of town is the College of Magic, towering over the rest of town. It’s a cathedral-looking thing, but a bit more magical and weird.

### Dustwharf South Gate + Streets

The muddy streets of Dustwharf are quieter than would be expected on a festival day. Rain is lashing down, and water is flowing down most roads towards the docks.

There are people wandering around fetching and carrying things, in greater numbers closer to the town square. In general everyone seems miserable and are keeping themselves to themselves.

If pressed then people will complain about the weather getting them down. It just never rains at this time of year. Some might blame “bloody outsiders”, and others might complain about “those damn wizards”.

### GM Notes

#### Smells

That horrible wet smell when it’s been raining for ages, fish, woodsmoke, soil.

#### Sounds

Rain hitting rooftops, wind in trees, creaking door signs, squelching footsteps, grumbling voices.

#### Sights

Rain, flooded roads, mud, stone cottages, Ocean’s View Inn, college towers in the distance dominating the town.

#### Touchstones

The general vibe of the streets should be like when the hobbits arrive in Bree. Miserable, distrusting locals, generally wet and horrible.

#### Names

Orela Nust, Randro Volen, Adriana Eskval, Vinceo Most, Ronfero Astor

### Ocean’s View Tapas Bar

This is a warm, welcoming, modern tapas restaurant and hotel, a nice place to go to hide from the weather. In fact, quite a number of the townsfolk have had the same idea, and it's pretty busy in here. The atmosphere is similar to outside rather than the festive cheer that would be expected, with people miserable and downbeat about the weather.

Vaeris Olmus the archaeologist is sitting alone at the bar. They’re looking for an ancient magical artefact to study. It’s rumoured that the College of Magic have some knowledge of its whereabouts, or perhaps even have it within their walls. The reclusive academic wizards there are refusing to answer the archaeologist’s inquiries. They’re looking for some more persuasive people to help them get hold of the artefact, or at least learn more about it.

The archaeologist doesn’t actually know what the artefact is, they just know it used to be a part of the Sun’s Return ritual in Dustwharf and is rumoured to have great power. Whether or not it ever actually existed is the main point of academic interest.

There’s also a really old bloke (Scaro Feldman) in here, wizened and shrivelled, and seemingly fuelled by alcohol, who will actually drop a big hint about how it’s the curse the wizards promised when his grandparents’ town elders forced them out of their role in the ritual. He’ll probably drop that in between completely nonsensical ravings about how it’s raining so much because the fish are invading or something similarly ridiculous.

### GM Notes

#### Smells

Smoke, alcohol, roasting meat

#### Sounds

Quiet chatting, grumbling locals, lute music

#### Names

Scaro Feldman, Faeris Utton, Staeskr Longstride, Kira Weston, Walfrey Greenfoot

### Dustwharf Town Square

The town elders are making preparations for the ancient Dustwharf tradition of the Sun’s Return (spring equinox) festival. Gazebos are going up because the weather is bad, but it hasn’t rained on Return in living memory. The elders are certain someone is trying to ruin the festival, and they reckon it’s the College of Magic.

They’re very much “it’s always been this way” types, and will tell a one-sided version of the ritual where the town elders have always been in control of making sure the sun returns properly.

### GM Notes

#### Smells

Smoke from cooking fires, sausages, bacon, onions, leather tents

#### Sounds

Grumbling elders, sizzling food, hammering/general construction sounds

#### Sights

Hastily constructed gazebos/tents, some people frying sausages, a gathering of elders

#### Touchstones

The elders are all extremely melodramatic and stuck-in-their-ways old people. Think horticultural society, or the more obnoxious old people in Midsomer Murders.

#### Names

Malrus Paeldaris, Prisa Nerus, Oscaerus Aefessu, Publius Scellus

### Dustwharf College of Magic

Specialist college in Conjuration and Transmutation.

#### School of Conjuration

The staff here can be cajoled into talking about an alumnus (staff or student? I think staff makes the tantrum funnier) who read into the ancient weather rituals as part of researching elemental magics. They discovered that it was the mages of this damn college who used to perform the ritual, and that power over the local people was stolen away by a previous generation of elders.

He spent a long time researching more and more about the ritual, and then disappeared a few months ago.

#### GM Notes

##### Sights

Summoning spots, magical lighting, bookshelves

##### Names

Garius Varlheim, Heidri Arando, Vanya Telcontar

#### School of Transmutation

The staff here can be persuaded into talking about the same alumnus, but in more detail. They know some of his research, since the weather ritual involved transmutation magics.

They also know some stuff about the artefact the archaeologist wants to find. It is a powerful artefact which had some use in the ritual, something to do with the sun. They also know that the now overgrown cave Seawatch Cavern used to be used in the ritual.

#### GM Notes

##### Names

Furca Grey-Mage, Rolfjorn the Gifted, Botten the Tiny

### Library

It’s like the library of your dreams.

The library contains an accurate account of the original form of the ritual. The artefact was actually only used for the mundane purpose of ensuring good weather for the partying, but the angry alumnus didn’t read that far. That mundane purpose was deliberately wrapped up in a fancy ritual, mostly as an excuse to have a good time (everyone loves a ritual).

The research done by the alumnus is here too, explaining how the artefact was a crucial part of the ritual, used to ensure the sun’s return in a weather temple now known as Seawatch Cavern. That’s backed up by some later accounts of the parties that can be found in the library too.

#### GM Notes

##### Smells

Books, leather, pine furniture.

##### Sounds

Rustling of books, soft footsteps, rain hammering on windows.

##### Sights

Shelf after shelf of books, caged books, reading nooks with small tables and plants, hanging lanterns, magical chandeliers, students working at tables and browsing shelves, large windows.

##### Touchstones

John Rylands Library, and generally all the nice library pictures you see.

##### Names

Marcus Quinius, Caeril Hertsson, Jeri Velando, Petra Velando

## Seawatch Cavern

### Entrance Hallway

This is entered through a large open cave entrance, and contains various bits of foliage along with a few boxes and general “someone lives here” accoutrements.

In the center of the room is a mound. Above it is a grate in the ceiling, with water occasionally dripping through onto the top of the mound. The mound has a deep 5ft wide bowl shape on top, engraved with a geometric pattern. There’s also a clear line engraved on the floor, which leads to and up the walls surrounding the open door at the other end of the room.

There are some fallen trees outside.

#### GM Notes

##### Touchstones

The way some Skyrim dungeons transition from cave into ruin.

### Riddle Room

This room is full of scorch marks and roughed-up ground. There’s obviously been a fight of some kind in here, probably involving mages. There are a couple of weather-themed pieces of sculpture in here, and the ceiling is intricately carved into an impression of the sky, with the sun in the centre.

Around some of the sculptures are pools of bubbling water. If the word water is said in the room, the water will bubble more intensely. On a second utterance, the pools will glow ominously. If it is said three times, four Lesser Water Elementals will rise from the pools and attack the party.

At the other end is a wooden door reinforced with iron and a magical ward. Above it is a stone tablet with the following text

Hold your tongue.
It runs, but never walks.
It babbles, but never talks.
It roars, but has no mouth.
It sparkles, but is not a star.
It will hold you, but only when cold.
In time, it moves mountains.
Give it to me.

The answer is of course water, and wetting the stone tablet will open the door. It needs a big splash ideally.

### Water Door

The penultimate room has a wooden door reinforced with iron and a magical ward.

In the center of the room is a mound with water pouring down the sides. Above it is a grate in the ceiling, with water pouring through onto the top of the mound. The mound has a deep 5ft wide bowl shape on top, filled with water and lined with glowing blue light. Emptying the bowl will open the door.

### Ritual Chamber

A room overlooking the ocean. It has a wizard on the other side of a 30ft wide chasm with the ocean in the bottom. On either side of the chasm there’s ruined pillars that once held a rope bridge, but it’s now long gone.

In front of the open window hole is a pedestal, with a large bowl of water on it. Dangling in the bowl from the wall above the hole is an amulet with a stone on. The stone is engraved with weather symbols, and a rain/cloud symbol is glowing blue.

The wall on one side of the window hole has a number of shelves, packed with fish bowls with fish in. The wall on the other side has shelves with books and scrolls, and an open door with a staircase behind it. Also on that side is a writing desk and a chair by a fire pit.

There’s a grate in the ceiling which leads into the room above where the wizard sleeps and keeps their belongings, to allow a watch over the main room.

The wizard is sitting in the chair next to the fire, relaxing and gazing out of the window enjoying the rain. They won’t notice the party unless they’re particularly loud. On being interacted with, they’ll express surprise at being found but will happily talk/gloat about their scheme. They’ll be a bit more cautious if the players have managed to sneak close by.

Their intention is to ruin Sun’s Return to kill the tradition off for good since it has been “sullied” by the exclusion of the mages. An even better outcome would be the festival returning to its roots and reintroducing the mages’ role, of course performed by only this wizard who cares about the “true” ritual. Ideally this wizard would hold the town basically hostage and have the townsfolk work for them, by controlling the local weather.

Despite this, the wizard is open to being talked around really. People will need to empathise with their side of things, the townsfolk did shove the mages out of the ritual for similar reasons in the first place after all. Learning their research is incomplete will also leave them feeling a complete idiot, and they’ll want help reconciling with the townsfolk.

The wizard can be provoked into a fight with some effort, which will cause two Water Elementals to rise up from the chasm. In combat Calrano will generally try to stay out of the way of the party and cast supporting spells.

#### GM Notes

##### Smells

Salt water, seaweed, fish.

##### Sounds

Crashing waves dominating all the other sound in the room.

##### Sights

Occasional sea spray bursting up from the chasm.

##### Touchstones

Sounds like “the cavern” at Whistling Sands, general Skyrim cave energy.
